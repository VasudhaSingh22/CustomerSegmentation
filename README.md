# Customer Segmentation:
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups or segments based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. This approach allows businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to meet the specific needs of each segment.

## Objective:
The objective of this customer segmentation project is to gain a deeper understanding of our customer base for a retail clothing brand and develop targeted marketing strategies to enhance customer engagement, improve sales, and maximize customer satisfaction.
